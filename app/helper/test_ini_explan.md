This is a classic Python import path problem. When you run `pytest` from your project's root directory, it doesn't automatically know that it should look for modules inside that same directory. As a result, when `conftest.py` tries to `from app.main import app`, Python can't find the `app` module.

The standard and best way to fix this is to tell `pytest` where your source code is.

### **The Solution**

1.  **Create a new file** in the **root** of your project (at the same level as `app/` and `tests/`).

2.  Name the file **`pytest.ini`**.

3.  Add the following content to this new file:

    ```ini
    [pytest]
    pythonpath = .
    ```

### **Explanation**

- **`[pytest]`**: This tells `pytest` that this is a configuration file.
- **`pythonpath = .`**: This is the crucial line. It tells `pytest` to add the current directory (`.`) to Python's search path before running any tests.

After creating this file, your project structure will look like this:

```
holistic-ai-backend/
├── app/
├── tests/
├── .env
├── pytest.ini  <-- YOUR NEW FILE
└── ...
```

Now, run your test command again from the project root:

```bash
pytest -v
```

The `ModuleNotFoundError` will be gone, and your tests will run correctly.
